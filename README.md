# Macro-Keyboard
Macro Keyboard with adjustable keys

## Features

* Adjust macros what you want to do for each key up to 30 buttons
* Macros saved in EEPROM and it is nonvolatile until the next override
* Hotkey support up to six buttons
* Open for development


## Requirements
### Hardware

* Arduino leonardo or and alternative microcontroller that have internal usb support
* Keypad
* Jumper wires male-male

### Software:

* Arduino ide or Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO add on
* Python and libraries: 
	* [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) 
	* [pySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial)

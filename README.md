# Macro-Keyboard
Macro Keyboard with adjustable keys

##Features


* Adjust macros what you want to do for each key
* Macros saved in EEPROM and it is nonvolatile until the next override
* Open for development


##Requirements
###Hardware

* Keypad
* Jumper wires male-male

###Software:
* Arduino ide or Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO add on
* Python and libraries: keyboard, pyserial
* Libraries for arduino: Keypad from
	*		Arduino platform if you are using PlatformIO
	*		Keyboard library, EEProm library is pre-installed ones 


##Features can be added:
